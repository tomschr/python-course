    "# Python Course: Virtual Environment\n",

    "## Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"virtual environment\" is a directory which is \"isolated\" from the rest of the system. It solves the “Project X depends on version 1.x but, Project Y needs 4.x” dilemma, and keeps your global system directory clean and manageable (according to the \"Hitchhiker's Guide).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about virtual environments, refer to the Hitchhiker's Guide at http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/.\n",

    "1. How to work with the virtual environment.\n",
    "1. How to install Python package inside the virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change to your working directory (the directory you usually work with; can be your home or anything else).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new virtual environment. You can use any name you want, but here we use `.env` to make it \"invisible\":\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```shell\n",
    "$ pyvenv .env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Activate the virtual environment. This changes your shell prompt to \"`(.env) ...`\":\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```shell\n",
    "$ source .env/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Work with your virtual environment (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deactivate your virtual environment after you are done:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```shell\n",
    "$ deactivate\n",

    "1. Update `pip` and `setuptools`. The latest packages are downloaded from PyPI. The exact version numbers depend on the current release of `pip` and `setuptools`:\n",
